To run this microservice architecture, you must first install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) then follow theses steps:

1. Build the images with docker-compose

`docker-compose build`

2. Run the images in their containers

`docker-compose up`

3. visit the website

`localhost:8080/frontend`

(note: the microservices take time to all go online)
